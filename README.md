# docker-image_classification
This GitHub repository aims to classify images thanks to a pipeline algorithm trained and tested on the MNIST dataset of Yann LeCun. Hence, this very simple Docker app can classify images and return a JSON file containing the result. 

## Docker

### What is Docker ?
"Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production." [1]

Docker is used in many firms and brands because it makes virtualization very easy to manipulate. Instead of installing a virtual machine on your computer - which needs lots of RAM permanently -, you only need to install Docker lcoally. It is called **lightweight virtualization**. Now you can work locally and share your files to others, even if they don't have the same environment : MacOs, Linux, Windows ... Life gets to be easier than ever !

### How to install Docker ?
You need to follow some operations in order to make Docker functional on your laptop. Please check this website to install Docker Engine on Ubuntu (approx. 10 minutes) : https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

If you work in a Windows environment, then you will have to meet the following prerequisites : you need one of the Windows version among Windows Professional, Windows Education and Windows Enterprise. Then you can get Docker Desktop on Windows : https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

If your work in a MacOs environment, please check the prerequisites and install Docker Desktop for Mac : https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

## Pipeline Classification of a MNIST dataset

In order to use this very simple app, you need to meet the following steps :

### 1) Install Docker
Please check the previous paragraph.

### 2) Download the MNIST dataset from Yann LeCun
You will have to download the MNIST dataset [2]. This dataset contains four files.
- train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz is the training set of images (60,000 images)
- train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz is the training set of labels (labels of the training set)
- t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz is the test set of images (10,000 images)
- t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz is the test of labels (labels of the test set)

Since these sets are compressed, you have to unzip the files. Check if your zipper hasn't renamed the files with **..** instead of **-**. You need :
- train-images-idx3-ubyte
- train-labels-idx1-ubyte
- t10k-images-idx3-ubyte
- t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte

Create a new folder *train* with the training sets of images and labels and another one *test* with the test sets of images and labels.

### 3) Clone this GitHub repository
Follow the instructions on GitHub to clone this repository. Put the *train* and *test* folders in it. [3]

[3] : The *train* and *set* folders have not been add to the GitHub repository because of the weigth of the files.

### 4) Open a new terminal 
And just execute these commands :

### 5) Use your own images and get the JSON file
Download your image of a handwritten number in the folder containing all the files and get the result !

### To know more ...
Fore more information about the code, open the explanation_code.ipynb on Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda) or Visual Studio Code (Python extension) to understand better the writing of the code.

### Special Thanks
Yann LeCun
